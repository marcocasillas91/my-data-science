- Feature selection
    - Use of Wrapper, mutual info and maximal information coefficient
- Model Selection 
    - Grid Search 
- Model Tuning
- Data visualization

## Football-ML-v2.0

Can be considered as version 2.0 of _Soccer Matches Prediction ML Project_:
- Upgrading my data science project structure
- Use of cloud storage and cloud computing
- Gathering data in a data lake so that I turn the info into relational database structure.
- Use of APIs to retrieve and update info
- Use of DVC as a data science project version control tool
- Integrating everything into a MLOPs platform (Databricks, MLFlow...)
